**GRAPHQL MOVIES DB**

In this project I creating graphql version of movieDB Rest API.

The frontend developers can consume **movieDB** data using **Graphql**, instead of **Rest API**.

This project works as a bridge between frontend developers and the rest server, It will get data from movieDB Rest APIs then return it as graphql.


To register for an API key visit oficial [movieDB ](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started)page.
